# Covid Counter

## What?
* This is a basic React clicker app.
* Click on the Good Things to lower the Coronavirus load. Click on the Bad Things to send us all to the hospital.

## Why? 
* I love React. I do. Fangirl here. Current job does not have React, and I do not want to lose it. Little apps after work keep me on the React tract, and dat's a fact, Jack.
* This is Hook-less so that I wouldn't forget how to use Class.
* It is something to get me through Rona 2020

## How
* Create React App (or CRApp)
* Sketch App (virus and mask)
