# Covid Counter

This is a basic React clicker app I created as an excuse to practice styling with CSS modules (vs my fav Styled Components), getting familiar with SVGs and Sketch, and not getting too down as I attempt to get through March and April 2020 with my fellow Earthlings.

Click on the Good Things to lower the Coronavirus load. Click on the Bad Things to send us all to the hospital.

notes: 
* create 3-5 good and bad habits that vary in value. 
* svg of coronavirus 
* maybe do these: graph, viral count (state) leads to mini coronas loaded in bg. (recharts?)
